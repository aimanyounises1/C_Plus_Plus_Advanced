# Solutions & Reference Implementations

This directory contains reference implementations, optimized examples, and interview preparation materials specifically designed for Software Engineering positions at Nvidia and other GPU computing companies.

## Directory Structure

### `/phase5_cuda/` - CUDA Reference Implementations
Production-quality CUDA kernel implementations with multiple optimization levels:
- Vector operations (addition, dot product, reduction)
- Matrix operations (multiplication, transpose, convolution)
- Memory optimization examples (coalescing, shared memory, banking)
- Advanced patterns (warp-level primitives, cooperative groups)
- Performance profiling and analysis

### `/algorithms/` - GPU-Accelerated Algorithm Problems
LeetCode-style problems with both CPU and GPU implementations:
- Array and string manipulation
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Dynamic programming on GPUs
- Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, shortest path)
- Tree traversals and operations
- Parallel patterns (map, reduce, scan, scatter/gather)

### `/interview_prep/` - Nvidia Interview Preparation
- Common technical interview questions with detailed answers
- GPU architecture deep-dives
- System design problems with GPU context
- Behavioral question frameworks
- Performance optimization case studies

### `/benchmarks/` - Performance Analysis Examples
- Benchmarking framework and utilities
- Real profiling results and interpretation
- Optimization progression examples
- Memory bandwidth and compute utilization analysis

## How to Use These Solutions

### For Learning
1. Start with the practice templates in `/practices/`
2. Attempt to implement them yourself first
3. Compare your solution with the reference implementation
4. Study the optimization techniques and comments
5. Run benchmarks to understand performance characteristics

### For Interview Prep
1. Review the interview_prep materials for common questions
2. Practice implementing algorithms without looking at solutions
3. Time yourself solving problems (45-60 minutes typical)
4. Focus on explaining your thought process clearly
5. Study the GPU architecture materials thoroughly

### For Portfolio Building
- Use these as references for your own projects
- Adapt optimization techniques to your use cases
- Document your performance improvements
- Create visualizations of your results

## Compilation Instructions

### CUDA Examples
```bash
# Single file compilation
nvcc -o output_name source_file.cu -O3 -std=c++17

# With compute capability (adjust for your GPU)
nvcc -o output_name source_file.cu -O3 -std=c++17 -arch=sm_80

# With profiling enabled
nvcc -o output_name source_file.cu -O3 -std=c++17 -lineinfo -arch=sm_80
```

### C++ Examples
```bash
# Standard compilation
g++ -o output_name source_file.cpp -O3 -std=c++17 -pthread

# With optimization flags
g++ -o output_name source_file.cpp -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -pthread
```

## Performance Testing

Each solution includes timing code. Run multiple times and average:
```bash
for i in {1..10}; do ./program; done
```

## Notes for Nvidia Interviews
