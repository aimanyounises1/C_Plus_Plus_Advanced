## How to Use This Repository

### 1. Follow the Roadmap
Start with Phase 1 and progress sequentially. Each phase builds on previous knowledge.

### 2. Practice Files
Each `.cpp` or `.cu` file contains:
- **Comment header** describing the topic
- **TODO** section explaining what to practice
- Empty implementation for you to fill

### 3. Compilation

**For C++ files:**
```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 filename.cpp -o output
```

**For CUDA files:**
```bash
nvcc -std=c++17 -O2 filename.cu -o output
```

### 4. Project Work
Major projects in `phase7_projects/` have their own README files with:
- Project overview
- Goals and requirements
- Key files to create
- Learning outcomes

### 5. Track Your Progress
- Complete files in order within each phase
- Comment your code thoroughly
- Write tests for your implementations
- Compare your solutions with standard library implementations

## Important Notes
